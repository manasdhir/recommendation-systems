I have made content based recommender system which gives recommendation based upon the content searched or consumed by the user . It uses count vectorization to convert unstructered data into structured format and 
then it finds cosine similaritie between the movie given by the user and the other movies in the dataset.Top 10 movies which are similar to the input on the basis of cosine similarity are recommended along with their
index value in the dataset.
